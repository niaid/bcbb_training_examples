This repository hosts a NGS workflow for RNASeq analysis in the folder “BCBB_RNASeq_Training_Traditional” consistinf of PowerPoint presentations, Word documents, and scripts.

For training, we have adapted this workflow into a single Jupyter/Rmarkdown notebook to help facilitate learning in the age of literate computing.

To use these materials, one must have one of the following environments set up:

Python programming language, Juypter package, any bioinformatics software referenced in the respective training notebook

R programming language, RStudio software, any bioinformatics software referenced in the respective training notebook
